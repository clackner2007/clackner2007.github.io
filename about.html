<p>I'm a postdoctoral fellow at the <a href="http://www.ipmu.jp">Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe</a> at the University of Tokyo in Japan. My work uses large astronomical datasets to understand the assembly of galaxies. Most of my work focuses on efficiently and effectively measuring the shapes of galaxies from imaging data.</p>
<p>I'm a member of the Hyper Suprime Cam project on the Subaru telescope. This is a large international team which will get 300 nights of data using a Gigapixel camera. This will give us a sample of more than 20 million galaxies out to redshift of ~1, when the universe was half as old as it is today.</p>
<p>Before moving to Japan, I did my PhD in astrophysics at Princeton with Jim Gunn and Jerry Ostriker, looking at the multiple components of galaxies in simulations and observations. Before that, I did a BA in physics at Columbia. While there, I spent summers working in Peter Allen's robotics lab on haptics. </p>
