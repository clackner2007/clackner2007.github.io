<p>I'm currently a data science fellow at <a href="http://insightdatascience.com">Insight</a> in Palo Alto. As a fellow, I worked with a non-profit in peer-to-peer lending on figuring out how to grow their lender base. <a href="http://clackner2007.github.io/zidisha_lenders">Here's a write-up of my work</a>.
<p>Before starting Insight, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the <a href="http://www.ipmu.jp">Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe</a> at the University of Tokyo in Japan. My work used large astronomical datasets to understand the assembly of galaxies. Most of my work focused on efficiently and effectively measuring the shapes of galaxies from imaging data.</p>
<p>I was a member of the Hyper Suprime Cam project on the Subaru telescope. This is a large international team that will get 300 nights of imaging data using a Gigapixel camera. This will yield a sample of more than 20 million galaxies out to redshift of ~1, when the universe was half as old as it is today.</p>
<p>Before moving to Japan, I did my PhD in astrophysics at Princeton with Jim Gunn and Jerry Ostriker, looking at the multiple components of galaxies in simulations and observations. I did a BA in physics at Columbia. While there, I spent summers working in Peter Allen's robotics lab on a haptics simulator for grasp planning. </p>
